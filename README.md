# eddy-microprobe
An example of Klipper config files for a bed-slinger that uses a combination of `BTT Eddy Coil` and `BTT Microprobe` for bed leveling. The `Microprobe` is used as a Z-endstop and `Eddy Coil` does the actual bed mesh scanning. The calibration steps should include running all configuration procedures for `Eddy Coil` and a `Z_ENDSTOP_CALIBRATE` for the `Microprobe`.
